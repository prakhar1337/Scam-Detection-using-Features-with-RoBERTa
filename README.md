# Scam-Detection-using-Features-with-RoBERTa

Social interactions on digital technologies is enabling
an explosion of online abuse like scams
costing billions of dollars per year (4). Thus
it is necessary to detect and classify sentiment
of scam. Scams can fester through emails or
other digital platforms but in this work we are
working with a labeled email dataset to solve
binary classification task i.e. email is classified
as ’scam’ vs ’no_scam’.
Pre-Trained models like BERT and RoBERTA
have been proved to be successful at a diverse
set of tasks. Previous work (7) suggests that feature
engineering can supplement deeper models
in case of social media and conversational data.
We propose to use both of these techniques and
try to improve the results by integrating them
with feature based information. We will be
evaluating following hypotheses:
1. Using feature based information into Pre-
Trained Models will improve the results for
solving binary classification problem to detect
sentiment of scam
2. We will experiment with various NLP based
techniques to establish
